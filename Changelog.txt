Changes for version 0.09

    Make the play controls and the now playing section align to the left, so they don't keep moving about
    Adding keyboard shortcuts and user dialog to configure them
        Note: In the config dialog, some keys don't show up as what's on the key. This appears to be a problem
        relating to different international keyboards and varies depending on OS and browser.
        However, the key combination will work even if it's displayed wrong. I'm looking into it.
