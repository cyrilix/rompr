==================
= Installing RompR
==================
Please read the installation instructions here:

http://sourceforge.net/p/rompr/wiki/Installation/

MacOS X Users
=============

Please read the instructions here:

http://sourceforge.net/p/rompr/wiki/Installation%20on%20Mac%20OS%20X/

Windows Users
=============

First, install a better operating system, then read this file again :)
Actually, it may well be possible to get this to run on Windows, if mpd or mopidy can be got
to work then there's probably a LAMP stack for Windows that will run apache and php
OK. But I don't intend to go buy a Windows computer just to find out.


Ubuntu Users can now install from my PPA:
==========================================

	http://launchpad.net/~fatgerman-m/+archive/rompr

Just follow the instructions to add the PPA, then

	sudo apt-get install mpd-client-rompr

This will install rompr and the Apache webserver. If you want to use a different webserver
such as nginx, please read the wiki link above.
