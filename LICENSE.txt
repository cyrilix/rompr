# This program is SpongWare.
# The use of SpongWare is entirely according to the following conditions:
# 1) You may use it or not, I don't care. Just don't winge at me, I hate that
# 2) It is provided 'as is'. Nobody is responsible for anything it might or might not do. 
# 3) You may distribute it freely, although I would advise against printing it out and 
#    throwing it out of the window, that stuff gets you fined
# 4) You may alter it if you wish, and distribute the altered version if you wish but 
#    you must include this license
# 5) Before installing this software, smile at someone you like
# 6) There is no rule 6
# 7) This notice must be included with any copy of the software you distribute
# 8) Adherence to 'coding standards' is to be regarded with suspicion. 
# 9) Let me reiterate clause 2. If this program goes wrong in any way, for example
#    it deletes all your data or perhaps it wipes the entire internet overnight and 
#    leaves the world a dead place, nobody is responsible. Deal with it.
#    Sometimes, shit happens
