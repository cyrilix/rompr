CREDITS
=======

This program makes use of lots of other stuff which are all released
under their own licenses, just to make it complicated.

The original inspiration came from phpMP, and the core of this app was lifted
directly from there.

jquery (http://jquery.com) and the jquery UI framework (http://jqueryui.com)
are probably released under the GPL or something. I dunno, their websites aren't
very clear on that point.

The md5 hashing algorithm code was taken from http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5
and is released under a BSD license

The jquery form plugin comes from http://malsup.com/jquery/form/
and also has two licenses.
