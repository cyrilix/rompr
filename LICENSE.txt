# 2) It is provided 'as is'. Nobody is responsible for anything it might or might not do.
# 3) You may distribute it freely, although I would advise against printing it out and

#    it deletes all your data or perhaps it wipes the entire internet overnight and
#    leaves the world a dead place, nobody is responsible. Deal with it.
#    Sometimes, shit happens

CREDITS
=======

This program makes use of lots of other stuff which are all released
under their own licenses, just to make it complicated.

The original inspiration came from phpMP, and the core of this app was lifted
directly from there.

jquery (http://jquery.com) and the jquery UI framework (http://jqueryui.com)
are probably released under the GPL or something. I dunno, their websites aren't
very clear on that point.

The md5 hashing algorithm code was taken from http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5
and is released under a BSD license

There's also Ben Alman's pretty damn good javascript debugging library
http://benalman.com/projects/javascript-debug-console-log/
which has two licenses. Presumably this means it can drive a lorry?

The jquery form plugin comes from http://malsup.com/jquery/form/
and also has two licenses.
