# rompr
 Web frontend for MPD and Mopidy 


Mirror of http://sourceforge.net/projects/rompr/

## Description

Rompr is a music player that lets you discover more about the music you love and discover new music you don't even know yet. It is a client for the mpd music server.
It plays your local music, internet radio, podcasts and anything supported by Mopidy - eg Spotify, SoundCloud, Youtube...

On top of all that, you can use Rompr in a browser on one computer to play music out of another. So if you have a media centre connected to your Hi-Fi, Rompr can control it. It supports most modern mobile devices too.
Its looks are inspired by Amarok 2.
Please use the [Wiki](http://sourceforge.net/p/rompr/_list/wiki?source=navbar) to get installation instructions and a basic usage guide.
