mpd-client-rompr (0.16) precise; urgency=low

  * My trouble is, I won't give up. The Launchpad system has more flaws
    than a skyscraper, which is causing me some grief. But with the aid
    of Nicotine mints I'm trying....

mpd-client-rompr (0.15) precise; urgency=low

  * Very nearly had enough of this. The instructions suck donkey ass
    and the system is needlessly overcomplicated. This is the final
    attempt, which inviolves bumping it up a major version number,
    which is something I really didn't want to have to do.

mpd-client-rompr (0.14-3) precise; urgency=low

  * Right, so I make some fixes, follow the instructions to the letter
    and the system (which is unintelligible) doesn't bother uploading the
    source package and the build fails.

mpd-client-rompr (0.14-2) precise; urgency=low

  * OK, so building packcages on a PPA is needlessly overcomplicated
    and it moans about the slightest things so there may be a few attempts
    at this until I get it right. The instructions are as good as useless.
