<p><b>WHAT?</b><br>
Rompr is all about discovery. Discovering more about the music you love and discovering music you don't know.
<p><b>WHY?</b><br>
The collectioniser aims to do what Amarok 1.4 used to do with my music collection.
The looks aim to do what Amarok 2 does with my music collection. It's an MPD and Mopidy client because my media center is over there.
Why is it called RompR? It just is. I think it was going to be an acronym but I gave up at 'R'</p>
<p><b>WHERE?</b><br>
Rompr is developed on Mac OS X. My media centre runs Mythbuntu and XBMC and is over there.<br>
