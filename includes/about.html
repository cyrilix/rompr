<p><b>WHO?</b><br/>
Most of the coding (good and bad) - Mark Greenwood<br>
Many patches, and instilling some life back into the project, espcially with regard to translation - Vitaly Ignatov</p>
<p><b>WHAT?</b><br>
Rompr is all about discovery. Discovering more about the music you love and discovering music you don't know.
That's why radio stations and Last.FM feature prominently and is why I like using it with Mopidy for Spotify support.
If you love music you should get a Spotify subscription and check out Mopidy if you're not already using it.</p>
<p><b>WHY?</b><br>
Rompr exists because it's the client I want. The collectioniser aims to do what Amarok 1.4 used to do with my music collection.
The looks aim to do what Amarok 2 does with my music collection. It's an MPD and Mopidy client because my media center is over there.
And I frequently have nothing better to do than fart around with Javascript and I want a client that doesn't look like it was made in the 1980s.<br>
Why is it called RompR? It just is. I think it was going to be an acronym but I gave up at 'R'</p>
<p><b>WHERE?</b><br>
Rompr is developed on Mac OS X. In the UK, where Last.FM still works. My media centre runs Mythbuntu and is over there.<br>
